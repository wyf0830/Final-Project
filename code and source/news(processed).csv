Alcoa has long sought to shut down the San Ciprian smelter in Spain's northwestern Galicia region, which has struggled to remain competitive in the face of high energy costs and low aluminium prices, leading to several years of losses."

Shareholders of Alcoa Corporation (Symbol: AA) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 0.3% annualized dividend yield can sell the January 2019 covered call at the $45 strike and collect the premium based on the $2.80 bid, which annualizes to an additional 5.2% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ), for a total of 5.5% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $45 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but AA shares would have to climb 35.1% from current levels for that to happen, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 43.5% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called."

For Alcoa, the most recent quarter brought huge pressure to its upstream business because of falling prices for base alumina and for commodity aluminum metal products. Moreover, restructuring efforts to boost its exposure to fast-growing industries and its plans to split into two separate companies could help Alcoa grow faster once commodity prices rebound."

That puts the company on very solid footing during the downturn, enabling it to wait out the storm as opposed to being forced to address its issues at the worst possible moment, like Freeport. It's that balance sheet strength that, when combined with its strong global resource portfolio, makes BHP Billiton the better option over Freeport-McMoRan."
