        <section id="Introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the era of algorithmic trading and data-driven financial analytics, financial news has become an important variable influencing investor sentiment and market behavior. Understanding how financial news sentiment affects stock price volatility is important for investors, analysts, and corporate executives</p>
            <p>Using NVIDIA as a case study, this project examines the relationship between financial news sentiment and its stock price between 2015 and 2024, aiming to reveal how media narratives potentially drive market reactions and investor behavior.</p>

            <h2>Data Description</h2>
            <p>Two main sources of data are used in this study:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>ðŸ“„ <strong>FNSPID Data Set</strong> (Cornell University): Containing daily stock price and time-aligned financial news text for S&P 500 companies from 2019 onward, we have selected some of NVIDIA's data to focus on its performance over the last five years.</li>
              <li>ðŸ“Š <strong>Yahoo Finance</strong>: Obtain historical stock price data for NVIDIA from 2015-2024 for a supplemental analysis window.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We use natural language processing (NLP) tools (e.g., FinBERT) to analyze the sentiment of news headlines and match them with daily stock prices to construct time-series sentiment scores to explore potential links between sentiment changes and returns.</p>
            <p><em>We integrate time-series financial news from the FNSPID dataset and historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance, focusing on NVIDIA. Sentiment scores are computed using FinBERT and aligned with stock returns to analyze potential predictive patterns.</em></p>

          <h2>Sentiment Score Explanation</h2>
          <p>
            The sentiment scores used in this project are derived from FinBERT, a financial-domain BERT model that classifies sentences as positive, neutral, or negative. 
            Each dayâ€™s average score is computed based on news headlines. The sentiment scores range from <strong>âˆ’1</strong> (most negative) to <strong>1</strong> (most positive).
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Positive sentiment (0.3 to 1.0):</strong> Indicates optimistic or favorable news.</li>
            <li><strong>Neutral sentiment (âˆ’0.3 to 0.3):</strong> Indicates balanced or factual news without emotional tone.</li>
            <li><strong>Negative sentiment (âˆ’1.0 to âˆ’0.3):</strong> Indicates pessimistic or adverse news.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, the average positive sentiment score is approximately <strong>0.65</strong>, while negative sentiment scores average around <strong>âˆ’0.5</strong> in our dataset.

                                         To better detect patterns, we filtered out sentiment scores below 0.2 and applied a linear regression line.  
                                         The slight downward slope suggests a weak negative correlation, possibly due to mean reversion after optimistic sentiment.

            <h2>Summary of Findings and Future Work</h2>
            <p>Based on the graphical analysis and model exploration, we came up with the following key findings:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Positive news sentiment typically corresponds to higher median stock price returns (see Chart 4), but the correlation between a single sentiment score and the next day's return is weak (see Chart 2).</li>
              <li>Sentiment distribution is highly concentrated in the neutral region, with fewer extreme sentiments (see Chart 3), suggesting an overall moderate bias in financial coverage.</li>
              <li>Heat maps reveal the existence of consecutive high volatility days in some years, which may be related to macro events or financial reporting cycles (see Chart 5).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The limitation is that this analysis is based on headline text only and does not introduce company fundamentals or macroeconomic data, which may omit other important influencing factors.</p>

            <p>Future work directions include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Combining deep learning models such as LSTM further models the predictive power of emotions on returns.</li>
              <li>Extend the study to multiple companies to analyze differences in sensitivity to emotions across companies.</li>
            </ul>
